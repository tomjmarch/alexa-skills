# alexa-skills

A quick and dirty dumping ground for the various Alexa skills and snippets I've messed around with. Some are published, some are half-finished, some are just slightly modified templates I've found online.

##### [londonAirQuality](../londonAirQuality)

+ Find out today's air quality forecast for London, powered by TfL Open Data
+ Uses APL to show breakdown of pollutant data on Alexa screens

##### [pickVacationDestination](../pickVacationDestination)

+ Want to get away but not sure where you want to go? Ask Alexa and she'll pick a location for you along with giving you a good reason to go there. Just don't ask her to organise the trip for you!
+ [`locations.js`](../pickVacationDestination/locations.js) contains the short list of 'random' facts

##### [isItTheWeekend](../isItTheWeekend)

+ Curious whether or not today is the weekend? Don't waste your time looking at your phone, remembering the day, checking the calendar or asking a friend. Just let Alexa tell you!
+ Not much to it, but it contains a very basic call/response function

##### [latestCommonsVote](../latestCommonsVote)

+ Curious what's going on in Parliament? What was the last thing they voted on in the House of Commons, and did it win? What's keeping the MPs busy? Ask Alexa and she'll tell you all the key details about the most recent vote/division in the lower house including how many votes for each side.

+ Pulls data that is licensed under the Open Parliament Licence v3.0

+ Uses APL to show breakdown of votes on Alexa screens
